## 🧠 Maintenance & Safety
* **Clear All:** Use the built-in "Clear All" function to reset the canvas for a new profile instantly.
* **Gold Master Rule:** This code is optimized for minimal maintenance. Future updates should focus on the JavaScript logic core within `app.js` to preserve the visual integrity of the CSS skins.
